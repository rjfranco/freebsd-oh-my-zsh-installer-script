# freebsd-oh-my-zsh-installer-script

The scripts assumes 4 things:

- You have curl installed
- You have git installed
- You have zsh installed
- You have sudoer privileges

If all that's true then you should be able to just do:

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rjfranco/freebsd-oh-my-zsh-installer-script/master/freebsd-ohmyzsh-install.sh)"
```
